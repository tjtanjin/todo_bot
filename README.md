### Features
Todo Manager Telegram Bot was created in a bid to bring the application closer to users. In a time where messaging applications such as telegram are found in majority of mobile devices, allowing reminders on these platforms is a function that is much desired. With such a function integrated into our application, users can more easily see our reminders as well as perform actions. 

While there is much more that can be added to this project such as allowing create, read, update and delete operations through telegram messages, current work on this project has been paused in lieu of the amount of time and effort that would be required. However, owing to the project structure of the Todo Manager project, the API endpoints for these operations are ready for use and implementing these features when I have more free time will be much more easier.
